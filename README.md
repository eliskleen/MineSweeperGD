# MineSweeperGD
most scuffed MineSweeper I will ever build

This is a minesweeper for the md470 micro controller

Its built in codelite as a "md470-startup" "type" project with Cross GCC compiling, and only tested with simServer.


Controlls:

 2 = upp
 
 4 = left
 
 6 = right
 
 8 = down
 
 A = open
 
 B = flag
